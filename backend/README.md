# Platform of Trust: Sample-app backend

You need pipenv to run the API, install with `pip install pipenv==11.10.1`

Then you can install and use the API by running `pipenv install --dev`.
No need for virtualenvs, just run `pipenv shell` to log in to the application 
virtual environment.

There are a few `invoke` tasks that you can use:

    dev            Run the application (use when developing).
    
Use `invoke --list` to list the tasks, and `invoke --help <task>` 
for more info on the task.
